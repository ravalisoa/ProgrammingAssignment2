## Functions caching inverse of matrix that may require 
## a long computation time.

## Create a matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## Compute the inverse of the matrix returned above

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
